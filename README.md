# chess_ai
Teach Grade 7~9 students how to write a Chess game in Python from scratch and then tinker with different types of bots and AI.

## Features

* this is primarily used for STEM education purpose
* it takes a step-by-step approach
* no tricky syntax is used
 
## Descriptions

* Each main?.py is a stand-alone Python source code that can run.
* Each main?.py is an individual lesson.
* Starting from main1.py and proceed forward to learn how to build a chess game step by step.
* After finishing main12.py, 2-player game is implemented (less some advanced topics)
* Starting at main13.py, a random bot, Monkey is introduced.
* In main14.py, a slightly better AI, Greedy, makes its debut.
* Ultimately, in main15.py, Thinky will utilize Minimax algorithm to defeat you!
* You could make two bots to play each other
* main16.py provides an UNDO facility
* main17.py is alpha beta pruning which speeds up MinMax
* main18.py adds checkmate detection, no move detection and notation
* main19.py refactor draw and image. Also fixed danger_zone for King movement
* main20.py prepare for Q-Learning. Setup Q-Matrix and train one game.
* main21.py training in 10 games
* TODO: Deep-Q Learning
